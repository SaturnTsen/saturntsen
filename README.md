## About

Hi there! I’m **SaturnTsen**, currently pursuing a dual degree at **École Polytechnique** and **SJTU**, specializing in **random phenomena modeling** and **artificial intelligence**.

As for my academic studies, I conducted research on neural network interpretability at the **[John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science, SJTU](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, and worked shortly on 3D generative models at the [**Mediabrain**](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/) Laboratory, affiliated with the [**Cooperative Media Innovation Center, School of Artificial Intelligence, SJTU**](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/Default.aspx). I also worked on Natural Language Processing, with a focus on cross-language semantics alignment and domain-specific programming language generation.
