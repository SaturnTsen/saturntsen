## About 👋

Hi there! I’m **SaturnTsen**, currently pursuing a dual degree at **École Polytechnique** and **SJTU**, specializing in **statistics** 📊 and **random phenomena modeling**. My research focuses primarily on **computer vision** 👁️ and **Diffusion Models**.

I’m currently researching **3D diffusion models** at the [Mediabrain](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/) Laboratory, affiliated with the [Cooperative Media Innovation Center, SJTU](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/Default.aspx).

## Projects 💼

- **Domain-specific Code Generation with LLMs**  
  *Project Lead, École Polytechnique, Sep. 2024 - Present*  
  - Designed and implemented the **[Envision](https://www.lokad.com/fr/)** domain-specific code generation system from scratch.
  - Developed a hybrid **RAG** pipeline integrating **FAISS semantic search** 🔍 and **cross-module dependency tracing**.

- **Research on AI Interpretability**  
  *Research Assistant, John-Hopcroft Center, SJTU, Jul. – Aug. 2024*  
  - Extracted **Shapley values** for knowledge distillation 🔬 and evaluated generalization ability in knowledge transfer.
  - Trained foundational models like **BERT**, **VGG**, and **ResNet**, and conducted robustness analysis 🧠.
